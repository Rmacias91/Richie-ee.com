          Calculated Flesh index score, and Prodcued Markov Text. Linked Lists, Junit,
          and OOP design were used. My work was done in various methods throughout the code.
          Previous Code was written by Coursera and I needed to understand/add/modify in this project.

          Using an RSS feed, I display the postions, magnitudes, and major cities/airpots
          on a global map. I used OOP deisgn, inheritance, Polymorphism, and objects.

          <p class="imgDescription">My favorite Project, the LED PANELS! These display text I write in a file.
          The C++ code to drive the LEDS was down by Hzeller. I wrote a python script which uses API's for grabbing the weather, time, etc.
          I put it in a box and use it at work. Mostly for Quotes from the Office. I learned how to integrate different tools,
         wrote C++ to have the text scroll on the LED Panels, used a raspberry Pi, and so much more! Here is a

          <p class ="imgDescription">My Senior Design Project, Spotter 1000. We bascially used a Pixy Camera
          to scan the room on our pan and tilt system. I made an extendable pole from 7 to 14 feet. Our
           camera was able to identify colors, so we scanned the room for unique colors of the sticky notes. Sent the cordinates
           to a grid system and filled in the grid on a mobile web app. <a href ="./conference_paper.pdf">Here</a> is the short
           summary of the project. We wrote a 90 page paper, but no one will read that.</p>
