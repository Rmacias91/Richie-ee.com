This Front End is killing me.... My friend recommended looking at someone else's source code to get an idea. After seeing her site,
I pictured my site being written by an 8 yr old with crayon. It was that bad.. So, I figured out she made an external CSS library for her site.
She also referenced pretty font from Google, and had a balling NAV element. I borrowed that NAV for sure. For the rest of the site, I'm changing up the
main.CSS to my liking. I'm also formatting the information differently. Either way, this helped a lot. I'll admit, she's pretty good at Front end.
This took wayyy to much time off my hands though and I need to spend less time blogging and more time on my actual project. As the project moves forward,
so will my website. <br><br>

I really need to stop making this blog so damn ugly.
