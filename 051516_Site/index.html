			Welcome to my Site! Glad you decided to take a visit. Here I display my portfolio of software projects

		<h3> About me </h3>
		<p>
			My name is Richard Macias, but everyone calls me Richie. I am the Magna Cum laude/Top 5% of my Electrical Engineering Graduating class of 2014, 
			University of Central Florida. I enjoyed learning and challenging myself but realized I didn't like Electrical Engineering. "Shocker." <b>All pun
			intended.</b> I knew inside I liked programming, since my first Bubble Sort in Assembly. I later found out about FPGA's and fell in love. I enjoyed 
			writing these logical stories. It was my favourite type of puzzle to solve. So, why didn't I switch over to Computer Science or at least Computer Engineering?
			It's a long story, but I chose to go the safe route of pursuing a graduate degree in optics. It was promised to be paid for and well life doesn't always work the
			way you want it. So, where am I now? Working as a protection and design engineer for substations in Chicago and studying my butt off at home doing what I love.
			I really want my work to show who I am and what I'm capable of achieving. Enjoy!
