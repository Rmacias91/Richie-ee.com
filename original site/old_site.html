			I created this website to help display my current and past <a href= "#Projects">projects</a> with mobile 
			and web development. I received a <b>Bachelors</b> in Electrical Engineering at University of Central Florida.<br>
			<br>I started enjoying programming about 3am in the morning my Junior year of College. I was creating
			a bubble sort in assembly. Since then, I have used Verilog on Altera and Xilinix FPGAS. After learning C++, 
			I moved up to higher languages and I'm currently working on Android mobile applications. For a hobby I read about 
			intruding networks and ways to bypass security systems on computers. I watched the first season of <u>Mr. Robot</u>.

		I prefer to read books to understand core concepts and the rest of my time writing software.
		I work in a fast paced environment as a protection and control engineer for AMPED-I. I work in a 3 man team.
		Our work is client based and typically this seems to be the biggest hurdle to overcome. Technically understanding 
		how the stations are put together is fairly simple, but meeting the customers needs can be challenging, especially with
		limited time. I'm learning a lot of management skills on top of the technical in this small and successful company.

Ok, maybe I'm joking on step 4.... maybe. But in reality (at least in my world),
it's time that matters most and how efficient you use it. We only get so much of it.
I swear I go out sometimes, but that doesn't stop me from thinking about what I love to do.

So, what is it I like to do?<br>
I like to challenges. I like to learn new things all the time.
 Programming is my Sudoku puzzle I can do everyday for fun.
 After watching Chris Cole's biography, I kinda realized you don't really need a reason to love something.
 As long as you do it, I think you're fine.<br><br>

<strong>Dream/Goal?</strong><br>
Change the world of course!<br>
<br>
I believe there are many people out there that are alone and scared in the world. Sure, technology 
can be cause, but it can also be a solution. I've used apps like "Meetup" and some dating
ones(everyone does nowadays!) To be honest, I've made some awesome friends and a great girl. So, I know these kind of social techniques helped me, which means
they can help others. I would love to change the world and bring people together. Even if I don't change
the world, I'd be happy improving at least one person's life.
I listen to motivating videos all the time and I would love to be one more example on how anything is possible.
