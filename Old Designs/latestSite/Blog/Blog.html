I created my site today. It's not the prettiest but it's a start. 
This is definitely not day one, but its day one of my site and this blog. Specifically, the Tic Tac Toe app.
I have been reading this book <b>Android Programming</b> The Big Nerd Ranch Guide. At first it was awesome! 
Here I was understanding all the concepts behind android applications and their life cycle. Until recently, I
participated in a meetup at 8th light. I do programming meetups as much as possible. One, because its hard to find
people like me outside of college. (I plan to go back for a masters when I obtain state Residency.) Two, I learn a lot
from more experienced programmers. Not always about coding, but things I would have never thought of asking. 
Anyway, I met mentor there I think, and he was experienced in Android. So, here I am being knowledgeable about the book and
he seemed pretty impressed! Then I asked him, what's a good way to learn? At least for himself. He replied to just make random
apps. I know how simple it sounded, but didn't realize how much I forgot from the book. Sure, I was doing the challenges and understanding
the logic behind the code, but I forgot how to actually write the code...
<br><br>

So, I did research. I always do. I also buy way too many books. My last project was a success(The LED ticker) because
I stopped researching the wrong things. I focused on writing code and only researching on how to make things work. It sucked initially,
but it felt like carrying a big ball over a hill. In no time I was breezing through and adding bells and whistles to it.
I've researched from apprentices at 8th Light that having a blog helps with learning, so I decided to write my own about the Tic-Tac Toe
app. Later, I look to use the Test Driven Development method. I might create a separate blog about
the book I'm reading about hacking. It's a great refresher to basic programming concepts especially in C and assembly. 
You really need to know your low level for basic overflow buffers, etc. I've pretty much learned hacking is spotting unintentional functions
in code. This book is kicking my butt, but its so enjoyable that I walk around the city, just reading it. Hopefully I don't get hit by a car one day.
<br><br>

Now I am writing my first app. I've wrote one with the book and online, but that doesn't count. This one will! I wrote the design out.
It will basically have 9 buttons. Be formed as a playing field for a tic tac toe game and every button press will have an X or O appear. Then
it checks for winning conditions and proposes who wins or if its a draw. Simple enough! I thought...
<br><br>

I literally had to google why static variables were used in the activity class. This was not a good start. I've done C++ OOP but it seems
I'm pretty damn rusty. Stack Exchange searches later, and I realized static variables will make sure that only one variable will stay no matter how many instances you
create of that class. Plus, it sticks with the Activity until its deleted from memory I think. This is why I go to programming meetups and my best pal is working for Orcale.
Yes Mario, I'm talking about you lol. So, its great to make string Tags for values Static. Besides that, I currently researching what "final" means.
Either way this is my start, and I will continue tomorrow after work. Work can be a blog.... but I choose to keep work at work. I know git commands on
the command prompt, but I'll learn how to use Android Studio to do this for me. This way, you guys can actually see my work. This site will 
progressively get better too. I look to add better images for my projects, rounded corners on the boxes, and a comment box for all the hate I will receive
for the ads. Just kidding. <br>
