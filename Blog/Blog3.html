It seems I'm very good at not finishing these apps. I didn't know too much about classes in Java ( Didn't do too much OOP)
but I started with a calcuatlor app. I was able to make a class and have it do all my functions needed, except
for the order of operations... I could have used a library already made, but that defeated of it being
my app.... anyways, I stopped on that after realizing I would need to make a tree and evaluate the tree in the correct order.
I listened to a google clean code talk on how the best way to do this was to have subclasses of the main class of a node.
Each would have one method of an operator or toString, etc. So, in the end its easy to understand, extend,
change, and have no if statements. I need to go back and do this. I'm learning OOP is very very important 
and I've never done this in school as an EE..

I'm now doing Udacity and just finished making a ListView. I made an xml that describes what each item
will contain. I have the main activity hold the fragment which has the listview. I like programmtically
having a fragment manager over the XML static version... I can't seem to get it to work. Plus I would never use it 
to begin with haha... but I tried twice. It seems the main activity is loading/inflating an incorrect XML layout.
Anyways, I made an adapter and the parameters were the main activity/getContect(), the layout of the ListView item,
and the one ID of the textView object inside of it, and the fake data List I made of the weather. It seems they 
made a Array of 7 elements, made a List<String> = ArrayList<String> =(arrays.ArrayasList(thatonearray))
Pretty Nifty. I'm going to try to change my standards to theirs for now, until I read the Clean Code book.
I wanna get the Udacity down, read the book NerdRanch book, and read the clean code book..  I also got an iphone 5, and 
and using my work pc. I want to see the difference between IOS apps vs Android. I want to do both eventually.
